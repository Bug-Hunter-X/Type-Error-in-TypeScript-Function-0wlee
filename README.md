This repository contains a simple TypeScript program demonstrating a common type error. The `add` and `subtract` functions are defined to accept two numbers and return a number. However, if you pass string arguments, a type error occurs. The solution demonstrates how to use type guards and type assertions to handle this issue.  The bug.ts file shows the original code with the error and bugSolution.ts provides a corrected version.
